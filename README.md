# Week-6
Files for War Game

The code is for the card game War. The game has two players, each getting a deck of 26 cards. Both players display a card at the same time and the player with
the highest card value wins the round and wins a point. There are 26 rounds. As opposed to traditional rules, there is no War when players tie. Instead, they get no points.
